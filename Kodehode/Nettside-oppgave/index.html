          <img src="/images/content-designated-driver.PNG">
          <p>This is Trucker Tom. He is currently working as a long-haul safety specialist, ensuring his human stays awake and alert during critical supply runs for food, catnip, and other essential items. Tom excels at seat-perching and window-watching, offering occasional judgmental glances when his human misses a turn. His keen sense of direction helps navigate the best routes to the nearest pet store, and his loud purring acts as an anti-anxiety system during traffic jams. Always ready to lend a paw, Tom ensures every journey is as smooth as his luxurious fur.</p>
          <h2>Surgeon</h2>
          <img src="/images/content-surgeon.PNG">
          <p>This is Surgeon Fluffy. She is currently working as a dedicated life-saver, ensuring her humans stay healthy and stress-free by expertly napping on their chests, purring at precisely 25 Hz to promote healing. Fluffy specializes in surgical strikes on unattended snacks and removing dangerous strings from the environment (or sweaters). Her precision paw-work and diagnostic meows keep her household in top condition, and shes always ready for an emergency cuddle consult. </p>
          <h2>String specialist</h2>
          <img src="/images/content-guitar-tuner.PNG">
          <p>This is Whiskers. He is currently working as a string specialist, expertly tuning guitars with his finely tuned ears and a swipe of his nimble paws. Whiskers has a knack for detecting flat notes and sharpening sounds with a quick nudge. When the mood strikes, he also moonlights as a sound effects artist, adding the occasional "meow" or the rustle of whiskers to your sessions. His contributions guarantee every jam session hits just the right note.</p>
          <h2>Master mechanic</h2>
          <img src="/images/content-mechanic.PNG">
          <p>This is Greasepaw. He is currently working as a master mechanic, specializing in engine inspections and warmth optimization. His preferred method involves a thorough nap directly on the engine, ensuring it reaches the ideal temperature for feline comfort. While he sleeps, Greasepaw claims to "listen for problems" through vibrations, purring occasionally to fine-tune performance. Known for his unique troubleshooting style, he guarantees that every car he rests on runs smoother.</p>
